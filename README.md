# test1
This is a project called sneak peak 1;
It has a lot of classes, elements, and properties;
The project was done primarily with HTML and CSS;
The codes are clean and I used semantic HTML;
I primarily used flexbox for the arrangement of properties;
Hover and dropdown content was also used in some areas in the style.css;
Active external links were also included in the HTML.
